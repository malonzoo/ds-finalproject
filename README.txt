PURPOSE:
The purpose of non-profit organizations to accomplish the good work they were
founded to accomplish. However, non-profit organizations--like any organization--
need sufficient resources and capital in order to accomplish their goals and
especially because they are non-profit organizations they necessarily do not have
the sufficient resources to dedicate to at the same time have a robust fundraising
platform and also work on their projects.

So the goal because trying to make the non-profit fundraising experience easier
and more effective to non-profit organization managers. Toward this end, managers
and fundraisers can utilize the power of their donor markets to drive fundraising.

This application helps fundraisers identify the most connected and ultimately
the most profitable network. By calculating "degrees of separation", a fundraiser
can identify-- according to "degrees" which networks would be best to utilize.
